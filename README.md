# Git & GitHub In-depth (Short Course)

In this Short Course*, we will provide a more in-depth look at Git and GitHub. 
Topics will include creating a simple repository and basic Git commands. Using 
our created repository, we will then cover important collaborative concepts, 
such as forking and making pull requests.

For this course, we will assume that you have a basic understanding of version 
control and have been introduced to Git and GitHub. There is no need to be 
fluent in Git or GitHub.

This course is intended to be highly interactive. In order to participate, 
please be sure that you have a GitHub account and a working version of Git 
available to you. If you need assistance with this, please attend CRDDS 
consult hours in advance of the session.

\* What is a Short Course? An RC Short Course is a training that provides 
an in-depth understanding of a concept, system, or tool. You can expect to 
leave a "Short Course" with a solid grasp of the topic.
